# Experiment-2

Aim - Study of list in python

Theory - Exploring lists in python, and using list commands such as max(),min(),sum(),list.append,list.remove,list.insert etc

max() : To find the maximum value in the list

min() : To find the minimum value in the list

sum() : To find the sum of all the values in the list

len() : to find out the size of the list

sorted() : to sort the list in ascending order 

list.sort() : To sort the list in ascending order

list.append() : to add values or items at the end of already existing list

list.remove() : to remove the values or items in the existing list

list.insert() : to add values or items in desired position in a list

we can also find out the average of the list by dividing sum by length of the list

Algorithm :

    Start the program.

    Create different lists containing various data types.

    Display list elements using indexing and slicing.

    Add new elements to the list using append() function.

    Remove elements from the list using remove() function.

    Find the maximum and minimum values in a list using max() and min().

    Display the final output.

    Stop the program.

 Conclusion :

Thus, the experiment was successfully performed and we studied the concept of lists in Python along with various list operations such as accessing, updating, adding, and removing elements. Lists help in storing and managing multiple values efficiently in Python programs.
